# Database

- A collection of operational data that is integrated and stored so that it can be shared by multiple users in a specific organization.
- An organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.

# Database vs. Spreadsheet

#### Database

- Designed to hold much larger collections of organized information.
- Allows multiple users at the same time to quickly and securely access and query the data using highly complex logic and language.
  
  #### Speadsheet
- Originally designed for one user.
- Great for a single user or small number of users who donâ€™t need to do a lot of incredibly complicated data manipulation.

# Types of Data

- **Structured Data**
- **Unstructured Data**
- **Semi-structured Data**

# Types of Database

- **Hierarchical Database**
- **Relational Database**
- **Non-relational Database**

# Concepts of Database

#### Database Schema

- A logical representation of data that shows how the data in a database should be stored logically. 
  
  #### Database Instance
- The data and information that is currently stored in the database at a specific point in time.
  
  #### Data Constraints
- Used to specify rules for data in a table.
  
  #### Data Dictionary (Metadata)
- A collection of metadata such as object name, data type, size, classification, and relationships with other data assets.
  
  #### Data Manipulation
- Insertion, Deletion, and Updation.
  
  #### Query
- Used to access data from the database to retrieve or manipulate data.

#### Physical Level

- Internal Level.
- Describe how data is actually stored in the database.
  
  #### Conceptual Level
- Logical Level.
- Describe how the database appears to the users conceptually and the relationships between various data tables.
  
  #### External Level
- View Level.
- Shows the relevant database content to the users in the form of views and hides the rest of the data.
