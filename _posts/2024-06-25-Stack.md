# Stack
- A linear data structure.
- LIFO (Last In First Out).

# Types of Stack
#### Fixed Size Stack
- A fixed size and cannot grow or shrink dynamically.

#### Dynamic Size Stack
- A dynamic size stack can grow or shrink dynamically.
- This type of stack is implemented using a linked list, as it allows for easy resizing of the stack.

# Operations of Stack
#### Push
- Add an element to the top , increasing its size by one.

#### Pop
- Remove the element from the top, decreasing its size by one and returning the removed element.

#### Peek or Top
- Retrieve the top element of the stack without removing it, allowing a look at the value without modifying the stack.

#### isFull
- Check if the stack is full or not.

#### isEmpty
- Check if the stack is empty or not.

#### Size
- Return the number of elements of the stack.
 
# Applications of Stack 

#### Function Call
- Stacks are used to keep track of the return addresses of function calls, allowing the program to return to the correct location after a function has finished executing.

#### Recursion
- Stacks are used to store the local variables and return addresses of recursive function calls, allowing the program to keep track of the current state of the recursion.

#### Expression Evaluation
- Stacks are used to evaluate expressions in postfix notation (Reverse Polish Notation).

#### Syntax Parsing
- Stacks are used to check the validity of syntax in programming languages and other formal languages.

#### Memory management
- Stacks are used to allocate and manage memory in some operating systems and programming languages.
