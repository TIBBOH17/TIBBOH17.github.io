# Queue
- A linear data structure.
- FIFO (First In First Out).

# Concepts of Queue

#### Front
- The index where the first element is stored.

#### Rear
- The index where the last element is stored.

# Types of Queue

#### Input Restricted Queue (Simple Queue)
- The input can be taken from only one end but deletion can be done from any of the ends.

#### Output Restricted Queue (Simple Queue)
- The input can be taken from both ends but deletion can be done from only one end.

#### Circular Queue
- The last position is connected back to the first position.

#### Double-Ended Queue (Dequeue)
- The insertion and deletion operations, both can be performed from both ends.

#### Priority Queue
- The elements are accessed based on the priority assigned to them.

# Operations of Queue

#### Enqueue
- Add an element to the front.

#### Dequeue
- Remove anelement from the rear.

#### Peek
- Return the front most element.

#### isFull
- Check if the queue is full or not.

#### isEmpty
- Check if the queue is empty or not.

# Applications of Queue

#### Job Scheduling
- The jobs are brought in the main memory and are assigned to the processor one by one which is organized using a queue.

#### Multiprogramming
- The programs in the main memory are organized in the form of queues. 

#### Operation on Data Structures
- Certain operations like BFS (Breadth First Search), and tree traversal uses queues.

#### Buffer space
- Queues are used in networking, during the transmission of data from the source machine to the destination.
