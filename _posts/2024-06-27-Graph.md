# Graph
- A non-linear data structure.
- A collection of nodes connected by edges.

# Concepts of Graph

#### Vertices (Nodes)
- The fundamental units of the graph.
- Every vertex (node) can be labeled or unlabelled.

#### Edges
- Being drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph.
- Connect any two nodes in any possible way.
- Every edge can be labelled or unlabelled.
 
# Types of Graph

#### Undirected Graph
- A graph in which edges do not have any direction.

#### Directed Graph
- A graph in which edge has direction.

#### Weighted Graph
- A graph in which the edges are already specified with suitable weight.

#### Cycle Graph
- The graph in which the graph is a cycle in itself.

#### Cyclic Graph
- A graph containing at least one cycle.
 
# Representaions of Graph

#### Edge List
- Represent the graph with respect to edges.
- Weighed edge representation by storing the starting node, the arriving node, and the weight in the list.

#### Adjacency Matrix
- Represent the graph in the form of the 2D matrix where rows and columns denote vertices.
- Each entry in the matrix represents the weight of the edge between those vertices.

#### Adjacency List
- Represent the graph as a collection of linked lists.
- Store nodes connected to a node as many as the number of connected nodes.
